            The Partners for Parkinson’s Program fosters meaningful connections 
            between students and individuals with Parkinson’s, aiming to reduce 
            social isolation while providing volunteers with a deeper 
            understanding of neurological movement disorders.

          Our organization anticipates hosting several expert speakership events, 
          volunteer training sessions, and social gatherings throughout the academic year. 
          No expenses are expected to be incurred.
